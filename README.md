# Interior Point Algorithm for Linear Programming Problems (LPP)  

  This repository contains an implementation of the Interior Point Algorithm, a powerful method for solving Linear Programming Problems (LPP).                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                         
  The Interior Point Algorithm is a class of methods that solve LPP by traversing the interior of the feasible region. It offers a more efficient and practical alternative to the       
  Simplex method, especially for large-scale problems.
